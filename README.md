Thanks for sharing the files! Based on the contents of your project setup, especially from:

- `index.html` which references a React entry point (`/src/main.jsx`),
- and `eslint.config.js` which includes rules and plugins for React, React Hooks, and React Fast Refresh,

your project seems to be a **React-based web application**, possibly something like a personal assistant app named **SARA** (as seen in the `<title>` tag).

ðŸ”§ Technologies/Libraries You Can Use in This Project

Depending on the features you want to add, here are some suggestions you can consider integrating:

1. **UI/UX and Styling**

- **Tailwind CSS** or **Bootstrap** for responsive design.
- **ShadCN/UI** or **Radix UI** for accessible and prebuilt components.
- **Framer Motion** for animations.

2. **State Management**

- **React Context API** for global state.
- **Zustand** or **Redux Toolkit** if the app gets larger.

3. **AI / Assistant Functionality**
   If SARA is meant to be an AI assistant:

- Use **OpenAI API** or **Hugging Face Transformers** for natural language processing.
- Use **SpeechRecognition API** (Web Speech API) for voice input.
- **Text-to-Speech API** for speaking back responses.

4. **Routing and Navigation**

- **React Router** for managing multiple views or pages.

5. **Forms and Validation**

- **React Hook Form** or **Formik** with **Yup** validation.

6. **Performance and Development Tools**

- **Vite** (most likely already used if you're using `main.jsx`).
- **React Fast Refresh** for hot module reloading (already partially set up with `eslint-plugin-react-refresh`).

7. **Backend (Optional)**
   If your assistant needs a backend:

- **Node.js + Express**
- **Firebase** for real-time database and hosting
- **MongoDB Atlas** with Mongoose
